# **Merchant Categorization using GPT**

This project automates the categorization of merchant names from transaction data using ChatGPT. The workflow involves extracting merchant names from raw transaction data and sending them to ChatGPT to return a cleaned-up merchant name along with a suitable category classification (e.g., Retail, Grocery, Entertainment, etc.). This process helps improve the accuracy of transaction categorization, enabling better insights into customer spending behavior. Edge cases and ambiguous names are handled through a combination of machine learning and rule-based systems to ensure high accuracy.

Key Features:
- Automated merchant name cleaning using AI.
- Intelligent categorization of transactions.
- Scalable and adaptable to different transaction datasets.
- Enhanced accuracy for downstream financial reporting or customer segmentation.

Tech Stack:
- Python
- OpenAI GPT API
- Data processing (Pandas)
- Integration with financial transaction datasets
