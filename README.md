# Business Type Classification
This project automates the classification of business types from transaction data. The workflow extracts business names from raw transaction data and utilizes an AI-powered natural language processing model to return cleaned-up business names with corresponding category classifications (e.g., Retail, Grocery, Entertainment, etc.). This enhances the accuracy of transaction classification, providing valuable insights for financial analysis and business modeling. Edge cases and ambiguous names are handled through a combination of machine learning techniques and rule-based systems to ensure high accuracy.
